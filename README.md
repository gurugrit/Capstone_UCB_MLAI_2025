# Berkeley Professional Certificate in ML and AI : 2025 Final Capstone Project
### Detection And Prevention of Fradulent Phone Numbers
 
Module 16.1 Covered this Research Question: 
"How can we detect and prevent fraudulent phone numbers used during user registration or profile updates (on organizations Identity Access Systems) to exploit SMS-based systems for monetary gain?"
This submission from Module-20 and the Successive Submission from Module 24 all add up to the Capstone Project for this course work.
Module 16 Capstone primary was a problem statement for the research project. Module 20 would delve into the Dataset and its understanding and building baseline model. This dataset will be primarily used to analyze and build surrounding ML/AI Models which would help us in our predictions.

The Final Capstone Project would be submitted as a part of Module 24.
# Dataset

The Dataset used for this project is my Organizations Dataset. External users who are customers and partners register onto our organizations prime site seeking in IT NetWorking Solutions and Products. They typicall go thorugh a process of registration and there after come back to update their personal profile data. Notifications during this process and primarily sent via Phones where they have to acknowledge. Many of these phone numbers are fraudulent. Rouge users or Organization accross geo locations exploit the SMS-Based systems for monetary gain and fraud. The Dataset used here is one such containing the listings of users and their phone numbers.
For keeping the confidentiality of the data and compliance the data itself is deidentified.

#### Datafile Name = Fraud_PhoneAnSMS_Dataset.csv

The original Dataset had a million rows. For keeping the Data size resonable for processing and based on the machine speeds and processing times the data size is curtailed to 50K and has 20 Columns.
