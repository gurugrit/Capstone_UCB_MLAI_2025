# Berkeley Professional Certificate in ML and AI : 2025 Final Capstone Project : Module-20
### Detection And Prevention of Fradulent Phone Numbers
 
Module 16.1 Covered this Research Question: 
"How can we detect and prevent fraudulent phone numbers used during user registration or profile updates (on organizations Identity Access Systems) to exploit SMS-based systems for monetary gain?"
This submission from Module-20 and the Successive Submission from Module 24 all add up to the Capstone Project for this course work.
Module 16 Capstone primary was a problem statement for the research project. Module 20 would delve into the Dataset and its understanding and building baseline model. This dataset with this module will be primarily used to analyze and build surrounding ML/AI Models which would help us in our predictions.

The Final Capstone Project would be submitted as a part of Module 24.
# Dataset

The Dataset used for this project is from my own Organizations. External users who are customers and partners register onto our organizations prime site seeking in IT NetWorking Solutions and Products. They typicall go thorugh a process of registration and there after come back to update their personal profile data. Notifications during this process are primarily sent via Phones for validations. Many of these phone numbers are fraudulent. Rouge users or Organizations accross geo locations exploit the SMS-Based systems for monetary gain and fraud. The Dataset used here is one such containing the listings of many users and their phone numbers now deidentified.
This is for keeping the confidentiality of the data and compliance.

#### Datafile Name - 🟨 Fraud_PhoneAnSMS_Dataset.csv 🟨

The original Dataset had a million rows. For keeping the Data size resonable for processing and based on the machine speeds and processing times the data size is curtailed to 50K and has 20 Columns.

# Note about the Files, Folder and Dataset...

-	The 🟢Code Folder will contain the Jupyter File.
- The 🟢Data Folder would contain both the Input data file at the root sourced for processing and modeling. The Data folder will contain the subfolder named "FraudPhoneNumber" which will contain the post analysis data of
  fradulent phone numbers found.
- The 🟢GraphPlots folder would contain 2 SubFolders - ⚪Supervised and ⚪Unsupervised. These subfolders will contain all the graphs for the respective models adopted in the project.

# Phases for this Project
## 1. Business Understanding and Objective
Organizations that rely on phone numbers for identity verification and SMS-based systems (e.g., one-time passwords, referral programs, financial alerts) are increasingly targeted by fraudsters using fake, virtual, or reused phone numbers. These malicious actors exploit identity systems to:
- ✅ Bypass user verification steps
- ✅ Abuse promotional or referral schemes
- ✅ Automate mass registrations using VOIP or synthetic identities
- ✅ Launder accounts for spam, phishing, or monetization
This undermines trust, increases operational cost (e.g., via excessive SMS volume), and introduces risk to both users and the business.

**Business Objective**: The goal of this project is to detect and prevent fraudulent phone numbers at the point of user registration or profile update within the identity access system. By doing so, we aim to:
- ➡️ Reduce abuse of SMS-based systems (OTP, promo rewards)
- ➡️ Lower operational costs related to fraudulent SMS traffic
- ➡️ Improve onboarding quality and user trust
- ➡️ Prevent future fraudulent activities linked to bad actors
- ➡️ Enable scalable, data-driven fraud risk scoring
