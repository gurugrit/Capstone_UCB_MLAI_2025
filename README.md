In this module, you will work on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to develop an initial report for your capstone project. You will use EDA to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling, hypothesis testing task, and data training to provide a better understanding of dataset variables and the relationships between them. You are encouraged to spend your time in this module cleaning your data and use feature engineering and EDA techniques to create visualizations to make sense of your findings. Additionally, you will also be required to use one of the ML algorithms you have learned so far in the program to develop a baseline model to use as a comparison in Module 24. You will have time in Module 24 to include additional models, clean the code, and make your work presentable for technical and non-technical audiences. For now, you will do the ‘heavy lifting’ of finding the answer to your research question.
